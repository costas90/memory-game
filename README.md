# Memory Game Project

A simple memory game using JavaScript to manipulate the DOM.

This project is part of the Frontend Nanodegree from Udacity.

## How it Works

Click on each card to flip it, and try to match 2 cards with the same symbol. Once you match all cards, you win!

The game will count your moves, time spent until winning the game, and give you a star rating. The more stars you have at the end of the game, the better your performance.
